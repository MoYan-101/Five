{Digital government transformation: A case illustrating public e-service development as part of public sector transformation},"Digital government is often seen as an enabler or even driver of transformation of public administration, with the objective of creating public value. Such transformations are complex, requiring a long process of change; often, digitalization of public services is seen as the main means to this end. We investigate how digitalization of public services can be related to public sector transformation, and how this development can be linked to public value. In order to do so, this paper first conceptualizes digital government enabled transformation based on literature. Thereafter, we present an empirical example of public e-service development in Sweden. This case illustrates how e-service development can highlight shifts in societal values, and challenges that follow when trying to sustain changing societal values. Our findings suggest that in order to sustain transformation and (changing) public value, multiple processes of change and redesign need to be in place, not only of the organisational processes involved, but also of regulatory and institutional aspects, such as changes to the law and in the discretion and work practice of public officials.",2018,3.0,Departmental responsibilities and administrative power,"We investigate how digitalization of public services can be related to public sector transformation, and how this development can be linked to public value.",,
{Big Data-Driven Public Policy Decisions: Transformation Toward Smart Governance},"Big data analytics (BDA) enhances knowledge and decision-making. Despite its importance, the connection between technical progress and political change is neglected in the administrative process. Most studies focus on e-government, e-governance, and how technology can improve existing operations of the bureaucracy. However, this article aims to explore the potential of BDA for public policy systems and provide a linkage for the transformation toward digital and smart governance using preferred reported items for systematic review and meta-analysis (PRISMA) approach to reveal the relevant documents and narrative review approach to interpret the application of BDA at each step of the public policy system. In addition, this study identifies several common public policy-related big data sources and techniques that could be used at the various stages of the public policy process. This study argues that BDA has the potential to be used for policy formulation in the four main phases—planning, design, service delivery, and evaluation. Most studies confirm its potential in the policy process for taxation, health, education, transportation, law, economy, and social system. This study reveals that it is also suitable for public policy execution stages, such as public supervision, public regulation, service delivery, and policy feedback. Previous studies have indicated that the application of BDA can transform traditional or manual governance systems into digital and smart governance. We contend that the policy cycle should be seen as a dynamic and iterative process characterized by continuous evolution. Though each step of transformation has its unique challenges in handling BDA and maintaining the Information and Communication Technology (ICT) infrastructure, it can ensure an accurate, prompt, and context-oriented public policy system. These insights provide a novel outlook on effectively managing the interplay between innovation and traditional approaches in the realm of public policy development.",2023,6.0,Government organizational structure,"Most studies focus on e-government, e-governance, and how technology can improve existing operations of the bureaucracy.","However, this article aims to explore the potential of BDA for public policy systems and provide a linkage for the transformation toward digital and smart governance using preferred reported items for systematic review and meta-analysis (PRISMA) approach to reveal the relevant documents and narrative review approach to interpret the application of BDA at each step of the public policy system.","Most studies focus on e-government, e-governance, and how technology can improve existing operations of the bureaucracy."

{Overdelivery in a digital service implementation on a tax recovery program},"This paper presents a case of a digital public service implementation for a tax credit recovery program and discusses its impacts and enhancements for the digital government context. An amnesty government program put in place demanded an agile digital service implementation to respond properly to citizens and society to reduce the face-to-face service of thousands of citizens and the burden on the public service infrastructure in place. The technical challenges found were overcome by adopting digital government good practices, such as the concepts of Government as a Platform (GaaS) and the use of microservices (APIs) on legacy systems. With the implementation of the digital service, a good part of taxpayers solved their demands online. Another part of the citizens that required assistance due to their digital illiteracy on the use of digital public services came in person to the tax office. Since the service could be accessed through mobile phones and the citizens were smartphone users, it was recognized as an unexpected opportunity to provide personalized on-site training to citizens on their own devices. This initiative helped reduce digital illiteracy and made it possible to build citizen capacity together with the provision of the digital service. The digital service implementation team recognized the importance of mobile responsive services in terms of providing the opportunity to offer personalized on-site training to citizens when needed. This represents a digital transformation in the form of providing citizens with training to access digital public services.",2023,1.0,Public service delivery,,,
"{Of algorithms, Apps and advice: digital social policy and service delivery}","Governments across the world have been developing and adopting new digital technologies for about a half of a century to support policy making and service delivery processes. Yet, until recently minimal critical attention has been given to this phenomenon and how it is transforming government. This paper reviews recent research on new and emerging technologies and the associated transformations they have for government policy and service delivery and the consequences for citizens and service users.

"{Digital government transformation and internet portals: The co-evolution of technology, organizations, and institutions}","Researchers and practitioners around the world recognize the potential of information technologies to promote government transformation. This transformation has been understood in at least two different ways: (1) as a transformation of internal processes and (2) as a transformation of the relationships between governments and other social and political actors (institutional transformation). Unfortunately, there is little or no evidence of such transformation, and current studies reveal that for this transformation to happen, a better understanding of the complex relationships between information technologies, organizations, and institutions is still required. This paper presents a theory of the co-evolution of technology, organizational networks, and institutional arrangements in the transformation of government. The theory uses the grammars of system dynamics and builds upon institutional approaches to understand interactions among all these variables in the development of information and communication technologies in government. Although the theory suggests the relevance of some specific reinforcing processes in this transformation, the endogenous view used in the theory empowers all stakeholders by illustrating how transformation could be promoted from any individual position involved in the process of developing digital government applications.",2014,6.0,Government organizational structure,,,
{Citizen-oriented digital transformation in the public sector},"Digital transformation has emerged as a term that describes the departure from digitization efforts to a full stack revision of the policies, processes and services in order to create simpler user experiences for citizens and frontline workers. While previous waves of digitization focused on the transition from analog to (parallel) digital services to increase efficiency and effectiveness of government services, digital transformation aims to redesign and reengineer government services from the ground up to fulfill changing user needs. At the center of these efforts are users-both internal and external users-of digital services who are included in the digital transformation efforts. This panel therefore brings together four aspects of digital transformation: a) dynamic capabilities as a precondition for digital transformation; b) co-design of digital services with users; c) digital co-production and co-creation to increase legitimacy of digital services; and d) co-creation with open data to improve digital service delivery.",2018,1.0,Public service delivery,"While previous waves of digitization focused on the transition from analog to (parallel) digital services to increase efficiency and effectiveness of government services, digital transformation aims to redesign and reengineer government services from the ground up to fulfill changing user needs.",,This panel therefore brings together four aspects of digital transformation: a) dynamic capabilities as a precondition for digital transformation; b) co-design of digital services with users; c) digital co-production and co-creation to increase legitimacy of digital services; and d) co-creation with open data to improve digital service delivery.

{Digital governance and collaborative strategies for improving service quality},"This paper explores changes in traditional political linkages and argues for greater use of a collaborative model (Figure 2) for achieving citizen access with information communication technologies (ICTs). There is substantial evidence that a 'paradigm' shift from bureaucracy-driven electronic to collaborative digital governance is taking place. Common factors which encourage or limit adoption of ICTs by governmental agencies include public administrators' distrust of non-professionals, government officials' fear of loss of control, lack of sufficient funding. Prospects for the future expansion of digital governance to deliver higher quality less costly government services in the current strict fiscal environment are assessed. The paper highlights case studies of emerging applications in selected cities and states where advanced ICT applications are being used to achieve operating efficiencies, program effectiveness, and productivity. Examples are given which can serve as 'benchmarks' for collaborative reforms. Digital governance strategies can promote both the politics and performance management potential for technological collaboration well as improve access to and satisfaction with government services. Emerging collaborative relationships among governments and public as well as private agencies not only result in a more efficient service delivery, but also lead to more accountable and interoperable administrative structure.",2014,5.0,Government organizational structure,,,Digital governance strategies can promote both the politics and performance management potential for technological collaboration well as improve access to and satisfaction with government services.
{Algorithmic Government: Automating Public Services and Supporting Civil Servants in using Data Science Technologies},"The data science technologies of artificial intelligence (AI), Internet of Things (IoT), big data and behavioral/predictive analytics, and blockchain are poised to revolutionize government and create a new generation of GovTech start-ups. The impact from the {\^{a}}€ smartification' of public services and the national infrastructure will be much more significant in comparison to any other sector given government's function and importance to every institution and individual. Potential GovTech systems include Chatbots and intelligent assistants for public engagement, Robo-advisors to support civil servants, real-time management of the national infrastructure using IoT and blockchain, automated compliance/regulation, public records securely stored in blockchain distributed ledgers, online judicial and dispute resolution systems, and laws/statutes encoded as blockchain smart contracts. Government is potentially the major {\^{a}}€ client' and also {\^{a}}€ public champion' for these new data technologies. This review paper uses our simple taxonomy of government services to provide an overview of data science automation being deployed by governments world-wide. The goal of this review paper is to encourage the Computer Science community to engage with government to develop these new systems to transform public services and support the work of civil servants.",2019,3.0,Departmental responsibilities and administrative power,,,
"{A data-driven public sector: Enabling the strategic use of data for productive, inclusive and trustworthy governance}","It is well understood that data play an important role in the way in which twenty-first century public services are administered. In fact, the successful implementation of the digital government approaches which the OECD recommends rely on this foundation of ‘data' to deliver on the potential of twenty-first century government. Over the last decade there has been an increased awareness of the role of data through the Open Government Data movement. Its success in seeing governments open up its information for reuse both inside, and outside, the public sector has proven significant in putting data at the heart of the transformation agenda. This Working Paper argues that governments now need to go further. The question of how data can be collected, processed, shared and reused is one that countries need to grapple with and place at the core of their thinking about digital transformation. Consequently, governments will move from a focus on the external publication of data towards a highly adept public service that is skilled in the recognition and use of data as a core component of a highly functioning state and the effective design and delivery of its activities.",2019,4.0,Leadership,"Consequently, governments will move from a focus on the external publication of data towards a highly adept public service that is skilled in the recognition and use of data as a core component of a highly functioning state and the effective design and delivery of its activities.",,
{Big data and transformational government},"The big data phenomenon is growing throughout private and public sector domains. Profit motives make it urgent for companies in the private sector to learn how to leverage big data. However, in the public sector, government services could also be greatly improved through the use of big data. Here, the authors describe some drivers, barriers, and best practices affecting the use of big data and associated analytics in the government domain. They present a model that illustrates how big data can result in transformational government through increased efficiency and effectiveness in the delivery of services. Their empirical basis for this model uses a case vignette from the US Department of Veterans Affairs, while the theoretical basis is a balanced view of big data that takes into account the continuous growth and use of such data. This article is part of a special issue on big data and business analytics. {\textcopyright} 1999-2012 IEEE.",2013,2.0,Leadership,,,"However, in the public sector, government services could also be greatly improved through the use of big data."
"{Towards a smart State? Inter-agency collaboration, information integration, and beyond}","Information technologies (IT) can now be considered one of the key components of government administrative reform. The potential is even greater when working across organizational boundaries. Unfortunately, inter-agency collaboration appears to face an even greater number of challenges than similar IT initiatives within a single organization. The challenges include data and technological incompatibility, the lack of institutional incentives to collaborate, and the politics and power struggles around a pervasive silo structure in most governments, among many others. This paper argues that there are clear trends towards greater inter-organizational collaboration, information sharing, and integration, which could lead, in the near future, to what might be called a smart State. The paper starts discussing the promises and challenges that have already been identified for government information sharing and integration initiatives. Then it describes two trends in terms of inter-organizational collaboration and information technologies in government settings. The paper ends by providing reflections about the technical and political feasibility, as well as the social desirability, of an integrated virtual State in which the executive, legislative, and judicial branches1 are actively collaborating and sharing information through the use of advanced information technologies, sophisticated coordination mechanisms, shared physical infrastructure, and, potentially, new organizational and institutional arrangements. {\textcopyright} 2012 - IOS Press and the authors.

{Digital Transformation of Public Services as State Transformation: An Overview of the Experience in Turkey During the Pandemic},"This paper discusses the contextual aspects of the digital transformation of the Turkish public administration system during the COVID-19 pandemic. It argues that the accelerating process of the digitalization of public services during the pandemic should be understood in connection with the ongoing, broader transformation of the Turkish state into the neoliberal regulatory state that has been ideologically framed as a facilitator of market-led economic development. This argument is based on the “state transformation approach” developed as an alternative analytical tool to address governance outcomes as a manifestation of neoliberally informed shifts in the location of state power, in the groups of actors that exercise state power, and in the ideas used to rationalize the exercise of it.",2023,6.0,Government organizational structure,,"This argument is based on the “state transformation approach” developed as an alternative analytical tool to address governance outcomes as a manifestation of neoliberally informed shifts in the location of state power, in the groups of actors that exercise state power, and in the ideas used to rationalize the exercise of it.",

{Collaborative digital government in Mexico: Some lessons from federal Web-based interorganizational information integration initiatives},"The use of information and communication technologies in government has been characterized as one powerful strategy for administrative reform. From recent experiences around the world, it seems clear that in order to enjoy some of the greatest benefits of digital government, the integration of information across organizational boundaries is necessary. However, these digital government initiatives face additional challenges, since the required level of interorganizational collaboration and trust is often not supported by existing institutional arrangements, organizational structures, and managerial processes. In fact, many institutions and administrative structures found in government contexts offer incentives for single-agency work only, which produces stove-pipe systems. Based on an extensive case study in the Mexican federal government, this paper explores how certain institutional arrangements and organizational structures can enable or hinder cross-agency collaboration and consequently, interorganizational information integration. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier Inc.

{One step forward and two steps back: E-government policies in practice},"A central goal of e-government policy is to increase efficiency in public administration, and one way to increase efficiency is via the increased use of automation and rule-based decision making. The use of data to streamline processes also has a prominent role in public policy today. This chapter specifically discusses the role of discretion in data-driven public administration. The empirical setting for this discussion is the Danish public sector which has been among the first movers to implement e-government solutions. Denmark has a long tradition of issuing public policies defining goals of front-office e-services as well as back-office digitization. Rule-based decision-making systems represent an ideal driver for actualizing the visions outlined in these policies. This chapter presents an experience where a rule-based decision-making system was introduced in an agency which handles complex cases requiring in-depth discretion by specialized professional caseworkers. This experience provides a platform for discussing possible challenges when implementing policy goals in an organizational context. This chapter also addresses the concept of “digital nomos”, the administrative norms of a digitized public administration.",2018,3.0,Departmental responsibilities and administrative power,,The article followed a qualitative research approach.,"It demonstrated how digitally transformed local government can solve service delivery problems through the deployment of digital technologies that improve decision-making, cut costs, streamline operations, and offer efficient services."
{Rethinking the Role of Local Government in Service Delivery in South Africa: Towards Digital Transformation},"The article provided insights into why local government and service delivery must be rethought in light of digital transformation. It exposed the significance of digital transformation in solving local government and service delivery challenges. The article followed a qualitative research approach. It employed document analysis and literature review as data collection instruments. It argued that digital transformation can help local governments in South Africa fulfil constitutional obligations and meet policy goals.

{Digital transformation: From hierarchy to network-based collaboration? The case of the German “Online Access Act”},"To unlock the full potential of ICT-related public sector innovation and digital transformation, governments must embrace collaborative working structures and leadership, is commonly argued. However, little is known about the dynamics of such collaborations in contexts of hierarchy, silo cultures, and procedural accountability. A widely voiced but empirically insufficiently substantiated claim is that bringing cross-cutting digital endeavours forward requires more lateral, network-based approaches to governance beyond traditional Weberian ideals. We test this claim by shedding light on three distinct challenges (complexity, risk, and power imbalance) encountered when implementing the specific collaborative case of the German Online Access Act (OAA) and by examining how they have been addressed in institutional design and leadership. Our analysis, which combines desk research and semi-structured expert interviews, reveals that flexible, horizontal approaches are on the rise.

{Digital Transformation in Public Services},"Digital transformation has fundamentally reshaped the landscape of public service delivery worldwide, with e-government emerging as a critical mechanism for enhancing government efficiency, transparency, and citizen engagement. This article provides a comprehensive analysis of e-government implementation in Indonesia, examining the trajectory of digital transformation in public services, the institutional frameworks supporting this transition, and the multifaceted impacts on service quality and governance outcomes. Through systematic literature review and critical policy analysis, this research explores the evolution of Indonesia's e-government initiatives from early adoption to current comprehensive digital service platforms, investigating both successes and persistent challenges. The findings reveal that Indonesia has made substantial progress in developing e-government infrastructure and applications across national and local government levels, with notable achievements including integrated digital identity systems, online business licensing platforms, and citizen complaint management systems. These initiatives have demonstrably improved service accessibility, reduced processing times, minimized corruption opportunities, and enhanced government responsiveness. However, implementation remains uneven across regions and government institutions, constrained by factors including digital infrastructure disparities, limited digital literacy among citizens and officials, organizational resistance to change, inadequate interoperability between systems, and cybersecurity vulnerabilities. The research identifies critical success factors for effective e-government implementation including strong leadership commitment, adequate resource allocation, comprehensive capacity building programs, citizen-centric design principles, robust legal frameworks, and collaborative partnerships between government, private sector, and civil society.",2025,1.0,Public service delivery,"This paper examines the transformative potential of e-government in public administration, focusing on its capacity to enhance service delivery, transparency, accessibility, cost efficiency, and civic engagement.",,
"{Toward a theory of e-government: Challenges and opportunities, a literature review}","This paper examines the transformative potential of e-government in public administration, focusing on its capacity to enhance service delivery, transparency, accessibility, cost efficiency, and civic engagement. The study identifies key challenges, including inadequate technological infrastructure, cybersecurity vulnerabilities, resistance to change within public institutions, and a lack of public awareness about e-government services. These barriers hinder the seamless operation and adoption of digital government initiatives. Conversely, the study highlights significant opportunities such as streamlined service delivery, enhanced transparency through real-time access to government data, increased accessibility for marginalized and remote communities, substantial cost savings, and greater civic engagement via digital platforms. Addressing these challenges through targeted strategies— enhancing technological infrastructure, bolstering cybersecurity, managing organizational change, and raising public awareness—can help policymakers and public administrators implement more effective and inclusive e-government initiatives. Additionally, the integration of these digital solutions can drive sustainable development and digital inclusion, fostering social equity and economic growth. By leveraging these opportunities, governments can achieve more efficient, transparent, and accountable governance. Ultimately, the successful implementation of e-government can transform the relationship between citizens and the state, building trust and fostering a more participatory democratic process.",2024,1.0,Public service delivery,The application and dissemination of data models serve for adequate semantic interpretation during information sharing and aim to achieve semantic interoperability.,"Therefore, we give some recommendations to introduce the data-centric approach that would enable the use of disruptive digital technologies and support the development of digital government in Russia.",
{Data-centricity as the key enabler of digital government: Is Russia ready for digital transformation of public sector},"The leaders of digitalization are developing digital government as a platform that stimulates public-private partnerships in the creation of innovative applications and services. The primary and permanent core of this platform is data, and it is the data ready for the information sharing and the provision of seamless public services. Growing digital world has formed the culture of interaction between government and society based on Open Data. The great importance has the ability of consumers to understand the meaning (semantics) determined by the provider, which is essential for the publication of Linked Open Data. The application and dissemination of data models serve for adequate semantic interpretation during information sharing and aim to achieve semantic interoperability. Both data-centric and model-oriented approaches are fundamental for the digital transformation of public administration. In this paper, we give a brief review of the leading countries digitalization experience and use it to outline the criteria characterizing the implementation of a data-centric paradigm. We have conducted the study showing if Russian e-government is ready for the digitalization in terms of the following areas: (1) the practice of information sharing; (2) the preconditions for the shift to a data-centric and model-oriented paradigm; (3) the regulatory barriers of digital transformation. We believe that the lack of data-centricity can become a serious obstacle to fulfill the plans of the “Digital Economy of Russian Federation” program.

{Collaborative Approach on Digital Government Transformation in West Java.},"The world is witnessing exponential growth and rapid change brought about by the advent of the digitalisation era. This change offers an opportunity to revisit the strategic approach on using Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs) to improve the delivery of public value. Considering that governments around the world are now facing declining levels of public trust. Using so-called digital transformation, governments adapt the wide use of ICTs to better support government functions, services, and citizens, encouraging their participation in policy-making processes. Successful government digital transformation often depends on the ability of multiple government or non-government organisations to collaborate towards shared objectives. However, most governments are far from fully exploiting the benefits of ICTs, and often forget that in some social groups, access to ICTs is limited at the point of digital inequality. This article provides an overview of how the Indonesian local government implements its digital-based policy, which is centered on an electronic-based government system in Indonesia (SPBE), linking cross-sectoral central government agencies. In recent years, government organisations have spent a large part of their budgets on information and communication systems and rely on these systems for their functioning. However, the complexity of the digital transformation still requires considerable effort, especially when it comes to a lack of ICT infrastructure, human resources, and bureaucratic culture. By using qualitative methods, knowledge is formed through the perspective and way of interpretation that comes from the participants included in the research, not limited to the research implementer.

{Evaluating the Impact of Digital Transformation on Public Service Delivery Efficiency and Accountability},"The digital revolution transforms public administration, notably service delivery efficiency and accountability. According to this study, the digital tools and platforms used by governments worldwide impact public service delivery efficiency and accountability. This study examines how digital technologies like e-governance and data analytics influence public sector operations and how organisational culture and leadership might offset these effects. A mixed-approaches design employing qualitative and quantitative methods achieved research aims. Semi-structured interviews and focus groups with public sector workers and others produced qualitative data, while surveys and secondary data analysis acquired quantitative data. Thematic analysis was done in NVivo for qualitative data, while descriptive statistics, correlation, and regression were done in SPSS for quantitative data.

{Challenges and Opportunities of Digital Transformation in the Public Sector in Transition Economies: Examination of the Case of Uzbekistan},"A key feature of the demographic transition in prosperous East Asian and other developing Southeast Asian states is fertility decline. Various pro-natalist policy measures, including baby bonuses and universal child care, have been undertaken by governments in the region, often with disappointing results. Like other social institutions in modern societies, housing can play a vital role in shaping fertility decisions, but its effect on fertility has largely remained unexamined. The ambiguous effect of housing affordability found in existing literature constrains the ability of governments to truly tap in to its potential to curtail fertility decline. We seek to address this gap by empirically examining this often-neglected relationship between house prices and fertility rates. We examine the relationship through the mechanism of housing wealth formation in Singapore, a country with one of the lowest replacement levels in the region but also with one of the largest public housing markets in the world. We use the resale price of public flats to test whether this wealth formation can potentially increase the likelihood of having more children. By doing a cointegration analysis of housing, income, and fertility, we confirm the “no flat, no child” belief prevalent among young Singaporeans. We find a negative long-run effect: a unit increase in the prices of resale flats reduces the total fertility rate (TFR) by 0.0036, statistically significant at 1%. Income is also found to negatively affect fertility. The variables included in the error correction model are also sensitive to disequilibrium. The resale prices also Granger cause the TFR both in the short and long run, and the effect is bidirectional. We emphasize how imperative it is for policy makers to seriously consider this effect in crafting housing and population policies. Pro-natalist measures may prove inadequate if other aspects of family living in Singapore do not significantly change.

{Redefining Collaborative Governance in the Digital Age: insights from an integrative systematic review on the role of ICT in collaboration},"Governments increasingly face wicked and complex problems that demand innovative approaches and multisectoral collaboration. The “collaborative governance” concept emphasizes government-led coordination among public, private, and civil society actors to foster consensus and collective action. Simultaneously, Information and Communication Technology (ICT) has emerged as a transformative force in governance, facilitating leadership, trust-building, and stakeholder participation. ICT remains peripheral in foundational collaborative governance frameworks despite its potential, revealing a critical conceptual gap in understanding its role. This study addresses this gap through a systematic review of two decades of academic literature (2003–2023). It focuses on how ICT is framed, its functional roles, and the tools it offers to support governance processes. The findings highlight ICT's capacity to reshape leadership dynamics, foster trust in distanced communication, and enhance participatory mechanisms. Recognizing the absence of a comprehensive framework, the study proposes adapting the “Integrative Framework for Collaborative Governance,” positioning ICT as an operational, non-human participant in joint capacity for action while trust and value-based decision-making remain human-centered. By bridging public administration and ICT scholarship, this research advocates for a paradigm shift that integrates ICT into collaborative strategies for addressing wicked problems.

It adopts an organized literature review, enhanced through revelations from bibliometric research. The results reveal that collaborative efforts among scholars remain predominantly concentrated in developed nations such as the Netherlands, Germany, and Sweden, whereas contributions from developing nations including Brazil, Pakistan, and Indonesia are markedly limited. Additionally, the oversight of digitalization within the scope of the readiness of an organization continues to significantly shape the efficacy of the implementation of digital transformation plans. Also, the terms discerned in the studied articles imply that the concept of 'digital transformation' is a significant theme linked with numerous subjects such as 'egovernment,' 'public services,' and 'innovation.' They further suggest the onset of a transition towards broader inquiries into the employment of artificial intelligence (AI), data-driven governance, and adjustments to governmental challenges. This study acknowledges certain limitations regarding data sources, which are exclusively derived from the Scopus database, thereby constraining the findings and rendering them insufficient to encapsulate a holistic investigation of digital transformation in public services. Consequently, it is advisable for subsequent research to explore a wider array of data sources from other esteemed databases to facilitate a more thorough analysis and yield novel insights.",2025,9.0,Government operating logic and processes,,,

{Doing more among institutional boundaries: Platform-enabled government in China},"The concept of Government as a Platform (GaaP) has recently encountered setbacks in practice worldwide. While existing literature on inter-governmental collaboration has emphasized organizational restructuring and data sharing, this study argues that a pragmatic way to improve administrative efficiency in the absence of formal institutional change is to adopt an alternative model to GaaP: platform-enabled government. Enabled by innovations of the middle-tier platform, this new model of platform governance integrates the functions of distributed systems of multiple departments into a sequential workflow without the requirement of institutional reform or sharing proprietary data. To demonstrate how this model facilitates information flow across institutional boundaries and improves collaborative governance, we analyze horizontal, vertical, and public-private collaboration using a diverse case study design.

{Transformasi Inovasi Pelayanan Publik menuju Pemerintahan Digital},"The digitalization of public services is an integrative process involving the application of information and communication technologies (ICT) in the administration of government services to the public. Its primary goal is to enhance efficiency, effectiveness, and the overall quality of public service delivery. By utilizing digital platforms, citizens can swiftly access information and perform various transactions without the need for physical visits to government offices. This study aims to analyze the transformation of public service innovation toward the development of digital government, using a descriptive qualitative approach. Data were collected through document analysis, in-depth interviews, and observation of digital service practices implemented by selected public agencies. Purposive sampling was applied to identify key informants. The findings reveal that the success of public service digitalization depends significantly on effective coordination among stakeholders, infrastructure readiness, human resource capabilities, and institutional willingness to reform existing procedures. Collaboration between the public and private sectors plays a crucial role in the design, implementation, and management of responsive and inclusive digital service systems.

{Digital Transformation of Public Sector Governance With IT Service Management-A Pilot Study},"Information Technology or IT is a combination of technology itself and a collection of IT services that ensure the effective implementation of overall Information Technology in an organization. Like other services, Information Technology Service Management (ITSM) has become a global subject because managing IT is only possible through efficient and effective ITSM protocols. A well-implemented ITSM delivery system improves the quality of IT services, which eventually enhances the organization's overall capacity and output. Public service delivery is closely dependent on the quality IT services that can be acquired through ITSM. This research study reviews some of the established ITSM standards and frameworks like FitSM, ITIL, CobiT, and ISO/IEC 20000 and proposes a most suitable and sustainable tool and its implementation roadmap for the digital transformation of public sector governance. For this pilot study, a public sector organization (PSO) working under the Government of Punjab (GoPb) was selected. This study focuses on an important area that has not yet been adequately addressed, where ITSM delivery can produce tremendous results.

"{Digital government, open architecture, and innovation: Why public sector it will never be the same again}","This article argues that the future of public services will be shaped increasingly by the evolution of global, Internet-enabled, digital platforms, with two distinctive technical and commercial features. First, use of open standards and architectures that separate standard business logic from supporting applications will allow government to become technology- and vendor-agnostic, freeing it from its overdependence on proprietary systems and suppliers. Second, over time, open standards and increased market choice will drive both innovation and progressive convergence on cheaper, standard ""utility"" public services. These two features will combine to create a powerful dynamic situation, driving disintegration of traditional ""black boxed"" technologies and services, traditionally organized around ""systems integrators"" and departmental structures, and their reaggregation around the citizen in the form of services. Such reaggregation is allowing progressively sharp distinctions between niche/innovative and commodity/standard offerings, supplied by a plural, innovative, and more cost-effective marketplace, with unprecedented implications for the way in which the state buys and deploys technology. We draw on a range of data from across public and private sectors to illustrate our argument and identify some key policy and implementation recommendations. {\textcopyright} 2013 The Author.

{Leveraging Agile Transformation: Redesigning Local Government Governance},"A change from bureaucracy as a machine to a lively bureaucracy is needed for future VUCA. Being ”agile” is a defence strategy for bureaucracy to handle disruptions. Transformation of local government from a hierarchical system to an agile bureaucracy while maintaining stability and sustainably delivering services to citizens in diverse spaces and times necessitates leveraging a range of factors. We conducted a systematic literature review to explore enabling factors that help leverage agility for local government governance transformation. Redesigning local government bureaucracy requires a shared commitment and an integrated central government policy framework for enabling the support system. We prescribe a new model of local government governance in disaster-prone areas, which needs to be supported by an elite team who are responsive, flexible and innovative in real-time. This group should have expertise in policy analysis, human wellbeing, health, food supply, communication, informatics, risk disaster management, and mitigation to maintain future governance.

{Digital Transformation-driven Decentralisation of Public Governance},"Decentralisation, also referred to as administrative decentralisation, has gained wide recognition as a governance model associated with efficient use of resources and innovative public service delivery. Thus, it is no surprise that many unitary countries and transnational governments have embraced this public governance model. Most recently, the discourse on decentralisation of public governance has become intertwined with digital transformation within the public sector. The rationale is that digital transformation was found to support the decentralisation of public governance, improving overall organisational efficiency and the creation of added public value for citizens. Based on a systematic literature review and fifteen semi-structured interviews with public sector experts, the paper discusses how digital transformation enables the decentralisation of public governance. Digital transformation supports public organisations' efforts to gain the most out of public governance decentralisation as it improves the efficiency of local and federal governments, citizen participation, citizen empowerment, public trust, and continuance of public administration.",2024,1.0,Public service delivery,,,Digital governance strategies can promote both the politics and performance management potential for technological collaboration well as improve access to and satisfaction with government services.
{Digital governance and collaborative strategies for improving service quality},"This paper explores changes in traditional political linkages and argues for greater use of a collaborative model (Figure 2) for achieving citizen access with information communication technologies (ICTs). There is substantial evidence that a 'paradigm' shift from bureaucracy-driven electronic to collaborative digital governance is taking place. Common factors which encourage or limit adoption of ICTs by governmental agencies include public administrators' distrust of non-professionals, government officials' fear of loss of control, lack of sufficient funding. Prospects for the future expansion of digital governance to deliver higher quality less costly government services in the current strict fiscal environment are assessed. The paper highlights case studies of emerging applications in selected cities and states where advanced ICT applications are being used to achieve operating efficiencies, program effectiveness, and productivity. Examples are given which can serve as 'benchmarks' for collaborative reforms. Digital governance strategies can promote both the politics and performance management potential for technological collaboration well as improve access to and satisfaction with government services. Emerging collaborative relationships among governments and public as well as private agencies not only result in a more efficient service delivery, but also lead to more accountable and interoperable administrative structure.",2014,5.0,Government organizational structure,Digital transformation (DT) is a strategic imperative for governments that aim to improve their services and efficiency.,"In this research, we employed a case study approach to investigate and analyze DT based on relevant events occurring in a five-year period.",Digital transformation (DT) is a strategic imperative for governments that aim to improve their services and efficiency.
{Towards a comprehensive understanding of digital transformation in government: Analysis of flexibility and enterprise architecture},"Digital transformation (DT) is a strategic imperative for governments that aim to improve their services and efficiency. Despite high expectations regarding DT practices, there is limited empirical evidence on how governments are approaching DT in a hierarchical bureaucracy context and how flexibility is created to enable progression. In this research, we employed a case study approach to investigate and analyze DT based on relevant events occurring in a five-year period. A conceptual model was created by combining the diamond framework, the technology enactment framework, and enterprise architecture scope to facilitate the chronological analysis of these events and reflect upon the creation of flexibility. The findings indicate that DT in government spreads in waves with adaptations in different organizational elements, impacting the whole administrative system from the provincial level to the country level and including both radical and incremental changes. Flexibility increases alongside progress in DT and can be technology-enabled or policy-enabled. The creation of flexibility also depends on organizational elements and bureaucratic levels. This study advocates a cross-level view to comprehensively understand DT and offers insights to help other governments craft DT agenda.",2020,7.0,Leadership,This study aims to analyze the role of e-government in enhancing the effectiveness and efficiency of modern public administration.,"Using a qualitative research method through literature analysis and in-depth interviews with government employees across several public service agencies in Indonesia, this study explores the benefits and challenges faced in the implementation of e-government.","The study's recommendations include strategies to improve information technology capacity, formulate policies that support digital transformation, and raise awareness and public participation in utilizing digital government services."
{Enhancing Public Service Delivery through Digital Transformation: A Study on the Role of E-Government in Modern Public Administration},"Digital transformation has become a crucial element in improving the quality of public service delivery, particularly through the implementation of e-government. This study aims to analyze the role of e-government in enhancing the effectiveness and efficiency of modern public administration. Using a qualitative research method through literature analysis and in-depth interviews with government employees across several public service agencies in Indonesia, this study explores the benefits and challenges faced in the implementation of e-government. The findings indicate that e-government significantly contributes to expediting public service processes, increasing transparency, and minimizing potential corruption and abuse of power. Furthermore, e-government enables more effective interagency collaboration through integrated information systems, positively impacting operational efficiency. However, the study also identifies obstacles to the adoption of e-government, such as limited digital infrastructure, resistance from government officials, and the digital divide in society, which can reduce its effectiveness. This study concludes that e-government can serve as a strategic instrument for public administration reform if supported by infrastructure improvements, human resource training, and increased public digital literacy. Consequently, e-government not only enhances the quality of public services but also strengthens accountability and public trust in the government. The study's recommendations include strategies to improve information technology capacity, formulate policies that support digital transformation, and raise awareness and public participation in utilizing digital government services.",2024,9.0,Government operating logic and processes,,,
{The Transformational Effect of Web 2.0 Technologies on Government},"Web 2.0 technologies are now being deployed in government settings. For example, public agencies have used blogs to communicate information on public hearings, wikis and RSS feeds to coordinate work, and wikis to internally share expertise, and intelligence information. The potential for Web 2.0 tools create a public sector paradox. On the one hand, they have the potential to create real transformative opportunities related to key public sector issues of transparency, accountability, communication and collaboration, and to promote deeper levels of civic engagement. On the other hand, information flow within government, across government agencies and between government and the public is often highly restricted through regulations, specific reporting structures and therefore usually delayed through the filter of the bureaucratic constraints. What the emergent application and popularity of Web 2.0 tools show is that there is an apparent need within government to create, distribute and collect information outside the given hierarchical information flow. Clearly, these most recent Internet technologies are creating dramatic changes in the way people at a peer-to-peer production level communicate and collaborate over the Internet. And these have potentially transformative implications for the way public sector organizations do work and communicate with each other and with citizens. But they also create potential difficulties and challenges that have their roots in the institutional contexts these technologies are or will be deployed within. In other words, it is not the technology that hinders us from transformation and innovation – it is the organizational and institutional hurdles that need to be overcome.

Taking an institutional perspective, and the strategic-relational approach (SRA), we examine the extent to which institutional design constraints leadership behaviours, and under what conditions leaders begin to adjust and/or challenge these design features adding to the knowledge of managing digitalisation of government. To this end, we present a five-country case study of national digitalisation projects across Europe. Our results show that while clear institutional design features such as established rules, project structures, and standard operating procedures are essential at the initial stages of the projects, leaders' skills in understanding and tailoring these features are critical to handle project-related problems and moving forwards towards implementation.

{Digital transformation and knowledge management in the public sector},"Digitizing public services is, at the moment, an essential necessity for numerous governments around the world. An improved government through digitization will not only have a growing effect on businesses, but it will also be able to intensify citizen engagement and push for economic growth. During the last 10 years more countries have progressively begun to provide digital services to their citizens. Therefore, in order to address this development, the purpose of this paper is to analyze the evolution of the digital government literature in order to describe the aspects of digital transformation in the public sector and how it is related to knowledge management. In this study the methodology is quantitative and it is based on a review and a survey made with the main goal being the estimation from several collected data on how the digital transformation process in the Public Administration takes place and what its relationship is with knowledge management. The review study is based on articles found on Scopus database and it addresses the role that digital government research plays in the theory and practice of knowledge management. In the survey study, 54 employees working for the services of the two governmental areas of the Portuguese Ministry of the Environment were surveyed. The results show that the research on the theme is still at an exploratory stage due to the lack of studies relating digital government to knowledge management effectiveness in the public sector.

{Automated impact assessment-How digitizing government enables rapid and tailor-made policy responses.},"As interest in the digital transformation of public administration grows, the main challenge remains to improve government governance systems and integrate a wider range of evidence into decision-making processes. The successful digitalization and application of such approaches improves the quality, responsiveness and flexibility of public administrations. The digialtization of processes has made it possible to use micro-level data to assess the impact of a policy or program and apply the feedback to improve the design and delivery of public services. Evidence-based policy-making evaluates programs based on their visible impacts. Large-scale data collected through digitized governance, coupled with econometric impact assessment, provides an ideal working toolkit for this. However, the current situation of European governments is one of slow adoption, as they are often slow to respond to new challenges. This is due to the static one-off impact assessment approaches used, the results of which quickly become outdated. With further digitalization, improvement of systems, and a rapidly changing situation, there is a need to speed up institutions' ability to quickly draw working solutions to offset the effects of unexpected events in society and economy and react without delays if policy effects dissipate. This paper demonstrates how a high level of digitalization in government allows addressing such issues by automating causal impact assessment and making it a continuous part of the service delivery. The use case is an automated system for assessing active labour market policies in Estonia using individual-level data from government digital registers. Building on this, it shows how impact assessment automation depends on automatically generated data, only available due to the digitalization of other public services, and how versatile it is when it comes to proving casual evidence in a suddenly changing environment.",2022,3.0,Departmental responsibilities and administrative power,,,Digital transformation improves public services by integrating digital technology.

"{Government 2.0? Technology, Trust and Collaboration in the UAE Public Sector}","Increased use of the Internet and related technologies in government seems to hold out promise for a collaborative governance model, derived from cross‐agency information and knowledge sharing, but many governments struggle to attain this goal. Over the past decade, many local and federal government entities in the United Arab Emirates witnessed a shift from the traditional, hierarchical ‘silos mode' of governance into a ‘competitive mode,' heavily influenced by ‘New Public Management' approaches. Although competition has had a relatively positive impact on government efficiency, there is evidence that it has increased institutional and policy complexity, reduced levels of trust and decreased knowledge sharing in government, thereby reinforcing information silos and hindering collaboration and cross‐government innovations. This article reports a national survey of UAE government employees in federal and local government institutions which found that ‘technology,' ‘leadership' and ‘trust' are perceived as the top three interconnected enablers of collaboration in the UAE government. The article concludes that there is now a possibility to move towards a more collaborative mode in governance, using technological innovations to bring down the cost of social transactions in government, with three key prerequisites: fostering a comfortable level of ‘political trust' between society and government, achieving a threshold of social acceptance of technology ('technological trust') within the public sector and reforming the ‘social trust' dynamics in society.",2010,5.0,Government organizational structure,Future research should focus on addressing the specific challenges faced by emerging economies and exploring the ethical implications of AI in governance.,"By synthesizing relevant theories such as the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT), Institutional Theory, and the Dynamic Capabilities Framework, this conceptual paper provides a strong theoretical foundation for understanding AI adoption in governance.","The findings reveal that AI-powered systems can significantly improve governance outcomes by enabling real-time insights and decision-making, while visualization tools enhance transparency and accountability."
{From recovery resilience to transformative resilience: How digital platforms reshape public service provision during and post COVID-19},"This paper investigates how government-sponsored digital platforms facilitated the transition from recovery resilience during COVID-19 to transformative resilience of city-level service provision post COVID-19. Using an in-depth case study of the Weijiayuan platform implemented in the Jiaxing City of China, we found that digital platforms played critical roles in both stages of COVID-19 and helped facilitate the transition from recovery resilience to transformative resilience. This transition was made possible by four conditions: adopting and experimenting digital platforms with public entrepreneurship, achieving a critical mass of usership, incentivizing the coproduction of public services, and generating accountability mechanisms for government responsiveness.",2023,10.0,Departmental responsibilities and administrative power,,"By harnessing the power of data coupled with machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI) techniques, a data-driven strategy poses to be an essential to approach in moving towards a smart citizen-centric e-government.",
{AI-Powered Governments: The Role of Data Analytics and Visualization in Accelerating Digital Transformation},"This study addresses the growing challenges faced by governments in utilising the potential of AI and data analytics for digital transformation, focusing on how these technologies can enhance public service delivery, transparency, and citizen engagement. Despite their transformative potential, majority of the governments struggle with the adoption and integration of AI-powered systems due to infrastructural, regulatory, and ethical concerns. The aim of this study is to investigate the role of data analytics and visualization tools in accelerating digital transformation within AI-powered governments. By synthesizing relevant theories such as the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT), Institutional Theory, and the Dynamic Capabilities Framework, this conceptual paper provides a strong theoretical foundation for understanding AI adoption in governance. The methodology involves a comprehensive literature review, analysing past studies and theoretical frameworks related to AI, data analytics, and public sector digital transformation. The findings reveal that AI-powered systems can significantly improve governance outcomes by enabling real-time insights and decision-making, while visualization tools enhance transparency and accountability. However, challenges remain, particularly regarding data privacy, digital infrastructure, and equitable access to services. The study's implications are both theoretical and practical. Theoretically, it contributes to understanding how AI and data analytics are reshaping governance, while practically, it highlights the need for governments to invest in digital infrastructure and develop dynamic capabilities to adapt to technological advancements. Future research should focus on addressing the specific challenges faced by emerging economies and exploring the ethical implications of AI in governance.",2024,9.0,Government operating logic and processes,,"In addition, a national public opinion survey examines the ability of e-government to influence citizens' views about government and their confidence in the effectiveness of service delivery.","Research examines the content of e-government to investigate whether it is taking advantage of the interactive features of the World Wide Web to improve service delivery, democratic responsiveness, and public outreach."
