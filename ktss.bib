abstract = {Digital government is often seen as an enabler or even driver of transformation of public administration, with the objective of creating public value. Such transformations are complex, requiring a long process of change; often, digitalization of public services is seen as the main means to this end. We investigate how digitalization of public services can be related to public sector transformation, and how this development can be linked to public value. In order to do so, this paper first conceptualizes digital government enabled transformation based on literature. Thereafter, we present an empirical example of public e-service development in Sweden. This case illustrates how e-service development can highlight shifts in societal values, and challenges that follow when trying to sustain changing societal values. Our findings suggest that in order to sustain transformation and (changing) public value, multiple processes of change and redesign need to be in place, not only of the organisational processes involved, but also of regulatory and institutional aspects, such as changes to the law and in the discretion and work practice of public officials.},

abstract = {Big data analytics (BDA) enhances knowledge and decision-making. Despite its importance, the connection between technical progress and political change is neglected in the administrative process. Most studies focus on e-government, e-governance, and how technology can improve existing operations of the bureaucracy. However, this article aims to explore the potential of BDA for public policy systems and provide a linkage for the transformation toward digital and smart governance using preferred reported items for systematic review and meta-analysis (PRISMA) approach to reveal the relevant documents and narrative review approach to interpret the application of BDA at each step of the public policy system. In addition, this study identifies several common public policy-related big data sources and techniques that could be used at the various stages of the public policy process. This study argues that BDA has the potential to be used for policy formulation in the four main phases—planning, design, service delivery, and evaluation. Most studies confirm its potential in the policy process for taxation, health, education, transportation, law, economy, and social system. This study reveals that it is also suitable for public policy execution stages, such as public supervision, public regulation, service delivery, and policy feedback. Previous studies have indicated that the application of BDA can transform traditional or manual governance systems into digital and smart governance. We contend that the policy cycle should be seen as a dynamic and iterative process characterized by continuous evolution. Though each step of transformation has its unique challenges in handling BDA and maintaining the Information and Communication Technology (ICT) infrastructure, it can ensure an accurate, prompt, and context-oriented public policy system. These insights provide a novel outlook on effectively managing the interplay between innovation and traditional approaches in the realm of public policy development.},

An amnesty government program put in place demanded an agile digital service implementation to respond properly to citizens and society to reduce the face-to-face service of thousands of citizens and the burden on the public service infrastructure in place. The technical challenges found were overcome by adopting digital government good practices, such as the concepts of Government as a Platform (GaaS) and the use of microservices (APIs) on legacy systems. With the implementation of the digital service, a good part of taxpayers solved their demands online. Another part of the citizens that required assistance due to their digital illiteracy on the use of digital public services came in person to the tax office. Since the service could be accessed through mobile phones and the citizens were smartphone users, it was recognized as an unexpected opportunity to provide personalized on-site training to citizens on their own devices. This initiative helped reduce digital illiteracy and made it possible to build citizen capacity together with the provision of the digital service. The digital service implementation team recognized the importance of mobile responsive services in terms of providing the opportunity to offer personalized on-site training to citizens when needed. This represents a digital transformation in the form of providing citizens with training to access digital public services.},

abstract = {Researchers and practitioners around the world recognize the potential of information technologies to promote government transformation. This transformation has been understood in at least two different ways: (1) as a transformation of internal processes and (2) as a transformation of the relationships between governments and other social and political actors (institutional transformation). Unfortunately, there is little or no evidence of such transformation, and current studies reveal that for this transformation to happen, a better understanding of the complex relationships between information technologies, organizations, and institutions is still required. This paper presents a theory of the co-evolution of technology, organizational networks, and institutional arrangements in the transformation of government. The theory uses the grammars of system dynamics and builds upon institutional approaches to understand interactions among all these variables in the development of information and communication technologies in government. Although the theory suggests the relevance of some specific reinforcing processes in this transformation, the endogenous view used in the theory empowers all stakeholders by illustrating how transformation could be promoted from any individual position involved in the process of developing digital government applications.},

Using collaborative governance frameworks and comparative case study of three cases of digital government in the Mexican states of Mexico, Puebla, and Yucatan, we extend current understanding of key determinants of effective inter-agency collaborations in digital government settings. In particular, our research question is as follows: how do leadership, governance, technology, and collaborative capacity and competencies contribute to effective collaboration? Our results indicate that all four components are important, but in different ways. Laws and regulations appear to play an important role supporting governance of the inter-agency networks in our three cases. In addition, multi-level leadership, formal governance, implementation flexibility, the role of technology as a social actor in itself, and trust building based on expertise seem to be particularly salient.},

The three countries are also among the front-runners when it comes to the utilisation of Information Communication Technology (ICT) in the public sector and have all showed significant achievements related to the digital transformation of public services production and delivery. Although many factors may account for their successes, what is the role played by their strategic approach to governance and inter-governmental cooperation models? How have governance and multi-stakeholder coordination and cooperation approach influences the success of the digital transformation and boost innovations in each of the three cases? The initial findings of this paper support academic that the digital transformation of the public sector largely depends on the focus, governance and intergovernmental coordination and cooperation. Specifically in guiding the use of ICT in building an efficient and user-oriented whole-of-government ecosystem for public service production and delivery. The analysis finds that a strong governance model with clear roles and responsibilities of all institutions complement with formal cross-sectoral bodies for decision-making and ensuring inter-governmental coordination and cooperation are essential for successful digital transformation. High levels of inclusiveness on across all levels of government, society and end-user groups is seen as a positive factor in all three countries. As a result, the success rate of the implementation of their respective ICT/Digital/eGovernment strategies is high, resulting with successful development of the ICT infrastructure, roll-out of key enablers, interoperability systems, technical and legal standards that allowed them as global leaders to move towards real user-centric, integrated service production and delivery. However, to verify the findings, this paper also identifies a set of "leap-frogging" countries for further research.},

The literature reviewed for this paper confirmed that the barriers and preconditions for a successful digital government transformation are complex and often not technology related. In fact, the introduction of new technologies by governments is always mediated by organisational, institutional, legal, ethical and social factors. Digital technologies may transform virtually every process, system and structure of government, resulting into redefinition of responsibilities and work routines of public officials. Nevertheless, they also create issues and trade-offs that merit careful consideration and preparation before a full-blown change is introduced. In conclusion, to enable to move from eGovernment to Digital Government transformation the application of new emerging technologies is the starting point but should not be considered in isolation from other intervening factors, from their possible combination, and from their specific characteristics.},

There is substantial evidence that a 'paradigm' shift from bureaucracy-driven electronic to collaborative digital governance is taking place. Common factors which encourage or limit adoption of ICTs by governmental agencies include public administrators' distrust of non-professionals, government officials' fear of loss of control, lack of sufficient funding. Prospects for the future expansion of digital governance to deliver higher quality less costly government services in the current strict fiscal environment are assessed. The paper highlights case studies of emerging applications in selected cities and states where advanced ICT applications are being used to achieve operating efficiencies, program effectiveness, and productivity. Examples are given which can serve as 'benchmarks' for collaborative reforms. Digital governance strategies can promote both the politics and performance management potential for technological collaboration well as improve access to and satisfaction with government services. Emerging collaborative relationships among governments and public as well as private agencies not only result in a more efficient service delivery, but also lead to more accountable and interoperable administrative structure.},

Its success in seeing governments open up its information for reuse both inside, and outside, the public sector has proven significant in putting data at the heart of the transformation agenda. This Working Paper argues that governments now need to go further. The question of how data can be collected, processed, shared and reused is one that countries need to grapple with and place at the core of their thinking about digital transformation.

abstract = {Information technologies (IT) can now be considered one of the key components of government administrative reform. The potential is even greater when working across organizational boundaries. Unfortunately, inter-agency collaboration appears to face an even greater number of challenges than similar IT initiatives within a single organization. The challenges include data and technological incompatibility, the lack of institutional incentives to collaborate, and the politics and power struggles around a pervasive silo structure in most governments, among many others. This paper argues that there are clear trends towards greater inter-organizational collaboration, information sharing, and integration, which could lead, in the near future, to what might be called a smart State. The paper starts discussing the promises and challenges that have already been identified for government information sharing and integration initiatives. Then it describes two trends in terms of inter-organizational collaboration and information technologies in government settings. The paper ends by providing reflections about the technical and political feasibility, as well as the social desirability, of an integrated virtual State in which the executive, legislative, and judicial branches1 are actively collaborating and sharing information through the use of advanced information technologies, sophisticated coordination mechanisms, shared physical infrastructure, and, potentially, new organizational and institutional arrangements. {\textcopyright} 2012 - IOS Press and the authors.

abstract = {The use of information and communication technologies in government has been characterized as one powerful strategy for administrative reform. From recent experiences around the world, it seems clear that in order to enjoy some of the greatest benefits of digital government, the integration of information across organizational boundaries is necessary. However, these digital government initiatives face additional challenges, since the required level of interorganizational collaboration and trust is often not supported by existing institutional arrangements, organizational structures, and managerial processes. In fact, many institutions and administrative structures found in government contexts offer incentives for single-agency work only, which produces stove-pipe systems. Based on an extensive case study in the Mexican federal government, this paper explores how certain institutional arrangements and organizational structures can enable or hinder cross-agency collaboration and consequently, interorganizational information integration. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier Inc.

abstract = {A central goal of e-government policy is to increase efficiency in public administration, and one way to increase efficiency is via the increased use of automation and rule-based decision making. The use of data to streamline processes also has a prominent role in public policy today. This chapter specifically discusses the role of discretion in data-driven public administration. The empirical setting for this discussion is the Danish public sector which has been among the first movers to implement e-government solutions. Denmark has a long tradition of issuing public policies defining goals of front-office e-services as well as back-office digitization. Rule-based decision-making systems represent an ideal driver for actualizing the visions outlined in these policies. This chapter presents an experience where a rule-based decision-making system was introduced in an agency which handles complex cases requiring in-depth discretion by specialized professional caseworkers. This experience provides a platform for discussing possible challenges when implementing policy goals in an organizational context. This chapter also addresses the concept of “digital nomos”, the administrative norms of a digitized public administration.},

It exposed the significance of digital transformation in solving local government and service delivery challenges. The article followed a qualitative research approach. It employed document analysis and literature review as data collection instruments. It argued that digital transformation can help local governments in South Africa fulfil constitutional obligations and meet policy goals. It demonstrated how digitally transformed local government can solve service delivery problems through the deployment of digital technologies that improve decision-making, cut costs, streamline operations, and offer efficient services. The article revealed that the digital divide, lack of technical expertise, data security concerns and resource constraints are some of the challenges that can affect the digital transformation of local government and service delivery in South Africa. These challenges must be resolved for digital transformation to play a significant role in improving the effectiveness of local government in service delivery. The article recommended that local governments in South Africa digitally transform in ways that foster equality and deliver local government services to all citizens.

abstract = {To unlock the full potential of ICT-related public sector innovation and digital transformation, governments must embrace collaborative working structures and leadership, is commonly argued. However, little is known about the dynamics of such collaborations in contexts of hierarchy, silo cultures, and procedural accountability. A widely voiced but empirically insufficiently substantiated claim is that bringing cross-cutting digital endeavours forward requires more lateral, network-based approaches to governance beyond traditional Weberian ideals. We test this claim by shedding light on three distinct challenges (complexity, risk, and power imbalance) encountered when implementing the specific collaborative case of the German Online Access Act (OAA) and by examining how they have been addressed in institutional design and leadership. Our analysis, which combines desk research and semi-structured expert interviews, reveals that flexible, horizontal approaches are on the rise. Taking a closer look, however, vertical coordination continues to serve as complementary means to problem-solving capability.},

This article provides a comprehensive analysis of e-government implementation in Indonesia, examining the trajectory of digital transformation in public services, the institutional frameworks supporting this transition, and the multifaceted impacts on service quality and governance outcomes. Through systematic literature review and critical policy analysis, this research explores the evolution of Indonesia's e-government initiatives from early adoption to current comprehensive digital service platforms, investigating both successes and persistent challenges. The findings reveal that Indonesia has made substantial progress in developing e-government infrastructure and applications across national and local government levels, with notable achievements including integrated digital identity systems, online business licensing platforms, and citizen complaint management systems. These initiatives have demonstrably improved service accessibility, reduced processing times, minimized corruption opportunities, and enhanced government responsiveness. However, implementation remains uneven across regions and government institutions, constrained by factors including digital infrastructure disparities, limited digital literacy among citizens and officials, organizational resistance to change, inadequate interoperability between systems, and cybersecurity vulnerabilities. The research identifies critical success factors for effective e-government implementation including strong leadership commitment, adequate resource allocation, comprehensive capacity building programs, citizen-centric design principles, robust legal frameworks, and collaborative partnerships between government, private sector, and civil society.},

The study identifies key challenges, including inadequate technological infrastructure, cybersecurity vulnerabilities, resistance to change within public institutions, and a lack of public awareness about e-government services. These barriers hinder the seamless operation and adoption of digital government initiatives. Conversely, the study highlights significant opportunities such as streamlined service delivery, enhanced transparency through real-time access to government data, increased accessibility for marginalized and remote communities, substantial cost savings, and greater civic engagement via digital platforms. Addressing these challenges through targeted strategies— enhancing technological infrastructure, bolstering cybersecurity, managing organizational change, and raising public awareness—can help policymakers and public administrators implement more effective and inclusive e-government initiatives. Additionally, the integration of these digital solutions can drive sustainable development and digital inclusion, fostering social equity and economic growth. By leveraging these opportunities, governments can achieve more efficient, transparent, and accountable governance. Ultimately, the successful implementation of e-government can transform the relationship between citizens and the state, building trust and fostering a more participatory democratic process.},

abstract = {The leaders of digitalization are developing digital government as a platform that stimulates public-private partnerships in the creation of innovative applications and services. The primary and permanent core of this platform is data, and it is the data ready for the information sharing and the provision of seamless public services. Growing digital world has formed the culture of interaction between government and society based on Open Data. The great importance has the ability of consumers to understand the meaning (semantics) determined by the provider, which is essential for the publication of Linked Open Data. The application and dissemination of data models serve for adequate semantic interpretation during information sharing and aim to achieve semantic interoperability. Both data-centric and model-oriented approaches are fundamental for the digital transformation of public administration. In this paper, we give a brief review of the leading countries digitalization experience and use it to outline the criteria characterizing the implementation of a data-centric paradigm. We have conducted the study showing if Russian e-government is ready for the digitalization in terms of the following areas: (1) the practice of information sharing; (2) the preconditions for the shift to a data-centric and model-oriented paradigm; (3) the regulatory barriers of digital transformation. We believe that the lack of data-centricity can become a serious obstacle to fulfill the plans of the “Digital Economy of Russian Federation” program. Therefore, we give some recommendations to introduce the data-centric approach that would enable the use of disruptive digital technologies and support the development of digital government in Russia.},

abstract = {The world is witnessing exponential growth and rapid change brought about by the advent of the digitalisation era. This change offers an opportunity to revisit the strategic approach on using Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs) to improve the delivery of public value. Considering that governments around the world are now facing declining levels of public trust. Using so-called digital transformation, governments adapt the wide use of ICTs to better support government functions, services, and citizens, encouraging their participation in policy-making processes. Successful government digital transformation often depends on the ability of multiple government or non-government organisations to collaborate towards shared objectives. However, most governments are far from fully exploiting the benefits of ICTs, and often forget that in some social groups, access to ICTs is limited at the point of digital inequality. This article provides an overview of how the Indonesian local government implements its digital-based policy, which is centered on an electronic-based government system in Indonesia (SPBE), linking cross-sectoral central government agencies. In recent years, government organisations have spent a large part of their budgets on information and communication systems and rely on these systems for their functioning. However, the complexity of the digital transformation still requires considerable effort, especially when it comes to a lack of ICT infrastructure, human resources, and bureaucratic culture. By using qualitative methods, knowledge is formed through the perspective and way of interpretation that comes from the participants included in the research, not limited to the research implementer. The data will be collected through literature study, in-depth interviews, and observations. The aim of the research is to describe how collaborative governance contributes to the policy process of using ICTs to deliver inclusive policies by local governments.            },

According to this study, the digital tools and platforms used by governments worldwide impact public service delivery efficiency and accountability. This study examines how digital technologies like e-governance and data analytics influence public sector operations and how organisational culture and leadership might offset these effects. A mixed-approaches design employing qualitative and quantitative methods achieved research aims. Semi-structured interviews and focus groups with public sector workers and others produced qualitative data, while surveys and secondary data analysis acquired quantitative data. Thematic analysis was done in NVivo for qualitative data, while descriptive statistics, correlation, and regression were done in SPSS for quantitative data. Quantitative analysis indicates that digital transformation strongly impacts service delivery efficiency (R² = 0.42, F (3, 246) = 15.67, p < 0.001) and accountability (R² = 0.36, F (3, 246) = 12.29, p < 0.001). Significant predictors of service delivery efficiency and accountability include digital transformation ($\beta$ = 0.45, p < 0.001), organisational culture ($\beta$ = 0.35, p < 0.01), and leadership ($\beta$ = 0.32, p < 0.05). Qualitative studies revealed that automation, real-time data sharing, transparency, and public involvement improve efficiency and accountability. This research found that digital transformation boosts public administration efficiency and accountability. Implementation needs a supportive workplace and good leadership.

abstract = {A key feature of the demographic transition in prosperous East Asian and other developing Southeast Asian states is fertility decline. Various pro-natalist policy measures, including baby bonuses and universal child care, have been undertaken by governments in the region, often with disappointing results. Like other social institutions in modern societies, housing can play a vital role in shaping fertility decisions, but its effect on fertility has largely remained unexamined. The ambiguous effect of housing affordability found in existing literature constrains the ability of governments to truly tap in to its potential to curtail fertility decline. We seek to address this gap by empirically examining this often-neglected relationship between house prices and fertility rates. We examine the relationship through the mechanism of housing wealth formation in Singapore, a country with one of the lowest replacement levels in the region but also with one of the largest public housing markets in the world. We use the resale price of public flats to test whether this wealth formation can potentially increase the likelihood of having more children. By doing a cointegration analysis of housing, income, and fertility, we confirm the “no flat, no child” belief prevalent among young Singaporeans. We find a negative long-run effect: a unit increase in the prices of resale flats reduces the total fertility rate (TFR) by 0.0036, statistically significant at 1%. Income is also found to negatively affect fertility. The variables included in the error correction model are also sensitive to disequilibrium. The resale prices also Granger cause the TFR both in the short and long run, and the effect is bidirectional. We emphasize how imperative it is for policy makers to seriously consider this effect in crafting housing and population policies. Pro-natalist measures may prove inadequate if other aspects of family living in Singapore do not significantly change. Governments faced by a st},

abstract = {Governments increasingly face wicked and complex problems that demand innovative approaches and multisectoral collaboration. The “collaborative governance” concept emphasizes government-led coordination among public, private, and civil society actors to foster consensus and collective action. Simultaneously, Information and Communication Technology (ICT) has emerged as a transformative force in governance, facilitating leadership, trust-building, and stakeholder participation. ICT remains peripheral in foundational collaborative governance frameworks despite its potential, revealing a critical conceptual gap in understanding its role. This study addresses this gap through a systematic review of two decades of academic literature (2003–2023). It focuses on how ICT is framed, its functional roles, and the tools it offers to support governance processes. The findings highlight ICT's capacity to reshape leadership dynamics, foster trust in distanced communication, and enhance participatory mechanisms. Recognizing the absence of a comprehensive framework, the study proposes adapting the “Integrative Framework for Collaborative Governance,” positioning ICT as an operational, non-human participant in joint capacity for action while trust and value-based decision-making remain human-centered. By bridging public administration and ICT scholarship, this research advocates for a paradigm shift that integrates ICT into collaborative strategies for addressing wicked problems. It underscores the necessity of sociotechnical approaches to governance and offers actionable insights for policymakers and practitioners navigating the complexities of an increasingly digital and interconnected world.},

abstract = {The substantial modifications enacted by governmental entities in the pursuit of digital transformation for the delivery of public services in the contemporary era have exerted a profound influence on the public service paradigm. Nevertheless, the execution of these transformations has encountered numerous obstacles in developing nations, including institutional inefficiencies, inadequate intersectoral coordination, and a workforce characterized by relatively low skill levels, which collectively hinder effective governance. This research aims to elucidate the degree to which organizations and management practices facilitate the implementation of digital transformation within public service frameworks. It adopts an organized literature review, enhanced through revelations from bibliometric research. The results reveal that collaborative efforts among scholars remain predominantly concentrated in developed nations such as the Netherlands, Germany, and Sweden, whereas contributions from developing nations including Brazil, Pakistan, and Indonesia are markedly limited. Additionally, the oversight of digitalization within the scope of the readiness of an organization continues to significantly shape the efficacy of the implementation of digital transformation plans. Also, the terms discerned in the studied articles imply that the concept of 'digital transformation' is a significant theme linked with numerous subjects such as 'egovernment,' 'public services,' and 'innovation.' They further suggest the onset of a transition towards broader inquiries into the employment of artificial intelligence (AI), data-driven governance, and adjustments to governmental challenges. This study acknowledges certain limitations regarding data sources, which are exclusively derived from the Scopus database, thereby constraining the findings and rendering them insufficient to encapsulate a holistic investigation of digital transformation in public services. Consequently, it is advisable for subsequent research to explore a wider array of data sources from other esteemed databases to facilitate a more thorough analysis and yield novel insights.},

To mitigate this gap in the literature, this study identifies and explains opportunities and challenges of data use and analytics found in a case of a U.S. state-government agency that is in charge of water quality management and has started to implement Evidence-Based Policy Making (EBPM). By drawing on four dimensions, data, technology, organization, and institutions, the results show how the organization's DDDM practices are enabled or constrained by nine types of determinants: data quality/coverage, compatibility/interoperability, external data, information technologies/software, analytical techniques, cooperation, culture, privacy/confidentiality, and public procurement. Overall, the findings imply that either quality data or advanced analytic techniques alone do not guarantee effective DDDM; organizational and institutional support is also needed for successful implementation.},

Digital transformation opens up opportunities and challenges to create business advantage by using the concept of digital capability as the ability of an organization o understand digital technology and use it to create business value, digital transformation is not only about implementing new technology, but also about changing the way of thinking and managing the business as a whole. Digitalisation and e-leadership can help improve transparency, accountability and public participation in decision-making processes in local government. In addition, local leaders are also using digital technology to improve communication with the public and get useful feedback in public policy making. In conclusion, digital leadership in the public sector is essential for governments and public sector organizations to keep pace with the rapid changes brought about by digital transformation. Effective digital leadership can help improve the efficiency, quality, transparency, participation and accessibility of public services, ultimately delivering better outcomes for citizens.},

While existing literature on inter-governmental collaboration has emphasized organizational restructuring and data sharing, this study argues that a pragmatic way to improve administrative efficiency in the absence of formal institutional change is to adopt an alternative model to GaaP: platform-enabled government. Enabled by innovations of the middle-tier platform, this new model of platform governance integrates the functions of distributed systems of multiple departments into a sequential workflow without the requirement of institutional reform or sharing proprietary data. To demonstrate how this model facilitates information flow across institutional boundaries and improves collaborative governance, we analyze horizontal, vertical, and public-private collaboration using a diverse case study design. We examine administrative review, law enforcement, and contact tracing during the pandemic in the context of China. Our findings suggest accommodating institutional boundaries is a practical and effective approach to advance the digital government agenda in decentralized contexts.},

By utilizing digital platforms, citizens can swiftly access information and perform various transactions without the need for physical visits to government offices. This study aims to analyze the transformation of public service innovation toward the development of digital government, using a descriptive qualitative approach. Data were collected through document analysis, in-depth interviews, and observation of digital service practices implemented by selected public agencies. Purposive sampling was applied to identify key informants. The findings reveal that the success of public service digitalization depends significantly on effective coordination among stakeholders, infrastructure readiness, human resource capabilities, and institutional willingness to reform existing procedures. Collaboration between the public and private sectors plays a crucial role in the design, implementation, and management of responsive and inclusive digital service systems.

These changes have also redefined the concept of leadership, and service delivery content has been significantly impacted. Developments in the technological frontiers have significantly impacted the role of human capital. As new technologies continue to influence business operations, customers and employees, companies are experiencing an unprecedented period of evolution and adaptation as they navigate this digital transformation era. This paper seeks to review leadership redefined with an emphasis on human capital as leadership champions of employees. The article further explores the leadership challenge of leading change concerning organisational culture and climate in the digital age. This paper used desktop research methodology to explore the new roles that human capital can carry out as strategic partners in delivering public value and revisiting the new roles of personnel administration in public service organisations. The grey literature and surveys were used as information-rich sources to glean the underlying factors, human perceptions, and experiences for embracing digital leadership to enhance service delivery in public service organisations. Thus, this paper established that digital governance works better within democratic environments than in autocratic environments. In conclusion, the study recommended that fostering transformational and exemplary leadership in democratising the public sector makes the environment user-friendly for digital technologies to enhance service delivery performance.

Like other services, Information Technology Service Management (ITSM) has become a global subject because managing IT is only possible through efficient and effective ITSM protocols. A well-implemented ITSM delivery system improves the quality of IT services, which eventually enhances the organization's overall capacity and output. Public service delivery is closely dependent on the quality IT services that can be acquired through ITSM. This research study reviews some of the established ITSM standards and frameworks like FitSM, ITIL, CobiT, and ISO/IEC 20000 and proposes a most suitable and sustainable tool and its implementation roadmap for the digital transformation of public sector governance. For this pilot study, a public sector organization (PSO) working under the Government of Punjab (GoPb) was selected. This study focuses on an important area that has not yet been adequately addressed, where ITSM delivery can produce tremendous results. This study contributes to academics and researchers since it discusses the selection and implementation of a service management system (SMS) for a PSO while focusing on its needs, requirements, and available resources. In general, the qualitative analysis methodology is used in this research study, and specifically, it can be identified as applied research.

abstract = {This article argues that the future of public services will be shaped increasingly by the evolution of global, Internet-enabled, digital platforms, with two distinctive technical and commercial features. First, use of open standards and architectures that separate standard business logic from supporting applications will allow government to become technology- and vendor-agnostic, freeing it from its overdependence on proprietary systems and suppliers. Second, over time, open standards and increased market choice will drive both innovation and progressive convergence on cheaper, standard "utility" public services. These two features will combine to create a powerful dynamic situation, driving disintegration of traditional "black boxed" technologies and services, traditionally organized around "systems integrators" and departmental structures, and their reaggregation around the citizen in the form of services. Such reaggregation is allowing progressively sharp distinctions between niche/innovative and commodity/standard offerings, supplied by a plural, innovative, and more cost-effective marketplace, with unprecedented implications for the way in which the state buys and deploys technology. We draw on a range of data from across public and private sectors to illustrate our argument and identify some key policy and implementation recommendations. {\textcopyright} 2013 The Author.

Transformation of local government from a hierarchical system to an agile bureaucracy while maintaining stability and sustainably delivering services to citizens in diverse spaces and times necessitates leveraging a range of factors. We conducted a systematic literature review to explore enabling factors that help leverage agility for local government governance transformation. Redesigning local government bureaucracy requires a shared commitment and an integrated central government policy framework for enabling the support system. We prescribe a new model of local government governance in disaster-prone areas, which needs to be supported by an elite team who are responsive, flexible and innovative in real-time. This group should have expertise in policy analysis, human wellbeing, health, food supply, communication, informatics, risk disaster management, and mitigation to maintain future governance.

Thus, it is no surprise that many unitary countries and transnational governments have embraced this public governance model. Most recently, the discourse on decentralisation of public governance has become intertwined with digital transformation within the public sector. The rationale is that digital transformation was found to support the decentralisation of public governance, improving overall organisational efficiency and the creation of added public value for citizens. Based on a systematic literature review and fifteen semi-structured interviews with public sector experts, the paper discusses how digital transformation enables the decentralisation of public governance. Digital transformation supports public organisations' efforts to gain the most out of public governance decentralisation as it improves the efficiency of local and federal governments, citizen participation, citizen empowerment, public trust, and continuance of public administration.},

abstract = {This paper explores changes in traditional political linkages and argues for greater use of a collaborative model (Figure 2) for achieving citizen access with information communication technologies (ICTs). There is substantial evidence that a 'paradigm' shift from bureaucracy-driven electronic to collaborative digital governance is taking place. Common factors which encourage or limit adoption of ICTs by governmental agencies include public administrators' distrust of non-professionals, government officials' fear of loss of control, lack of sufficient funding. Prospects for the future expansion of digital governance to deliver higher quality less costly government services in the current strict fiscal environment are assessed. The paper highlights case studies of emerging applications in selected cities and states where advanced ICT applications are being used to achieve operating efficiencies, program effectiveness, and productivity. Examples are given which can serve as 'benchmarks' for collaborative reforms. Digital governance strategies can promote both the politics and performance management potential for technological collaboration well as improve access to and satisfaction with government services. Emerging collaborative relationships among governments and public as well as private agencies not only result in a more efficient service delivery, but also lead to more accountable and interoperable administrative structure.},

Despite high expectations regarding DT practices, there is limited empirical evidence on how governments are approaching DT in a hierarchical bureaucracy context and how flexibility is created to enable progression. In this research, we employed a case study approach to investigate and analyze DT based on relevant events occurring in a five-year period. A conceptual model was created by combining the diamond framework, the technology enactment framework, and enterprise architecture scope to facilitate the chronological analysis of these events and reflect upon the creation of flexibility. The findings indicate that DT in government spreads in waves with adaptations in different organizational elements, impacting the whole administrative system from the provincial level to the country level and including both radical and incremental changes. Flexibility increases alongside progress in DT and can be technology-enabled or policy-enabled. The creation of flexibility also depends on organizational elements and bureaucratic levels. This study advocates a cross-level view to comprehensively understand DT and offers insights to help other governments craft DT agenda.},

This study aims to analyze the role of e-government in enhancing the effectiveness and efficiency of modern public administration. Using a qualitative research method through literature analysis and in-depth interviews with government employees across several public service agencies in Indonesia, this study explores the benefits and challenges faced in the implementation of e-government. The findings indicate that e-government significantly contributes to expediting public service processes, increasing transparency, and minimizing potential corruption and abuse of power. Furthermore, e-government enables more effective interagency collaboration through integrated information systems, positively impacting operational efficiency. However, the study also identifies obstacles to the adoption of e-government, such as limited digital infrastructure, resistance from government officials, and the digital divide in society, which can reduce its effectiveness. This study concludes that e-government can serve as a strategic instrument for public administration reform if supported by infrastructure improvements, human resource training, and increased public digital literacy. Consequently, e-government not only enhances the quality of public services but also strengthens accountability and public trust in the government. The study's recommendations include strategies to improve information technology capacity, formulate policies that support digital transformation, and raise awareness and public participation in utilizing digital government services.},

abstract = {Web 2.0 technologies are now being deployed in government settings. For example, public agencies have used blogs to communicate information on public hearings, wikis and RSS feeds to coordinate work, and wikis to internally share expertise, and intelligence information. The potential for Web 2.0 tools create a public sector paradox. On the one hand, they have the potential to create real transformative opportunities related to key public sector issues of transparency, accountability, communication and collaboration, and to promote deeper levels of civic engagement. On the other hand, information flow within government, across government agencies and between government and the public is often highly restricted through regulations, specific reporting structures and therefore usually delayed through the filter of the bureaucratic constraints. What the emergent application and popularity of Web 2.0 tools show is that there is an apparent need within government to create, distribute and collect information outside the given hierarchical information flow. Clearly, these most recent Internet technologies are creating dramatic changes in the way people at a peer-to-peer production level communicate and collaborate over the Internet. And these have potentially transformative implications for the way public sector organizations do work and communicate with each other and with citizens. But they also create potential difficulties and challenges that have their roots in the institutional contexts these technologies are or will be deployed within. In other words, it is not the technology that hinders us from transformation and innovation – it is the organizational and institutional hurdles that need to be overcome. This paper provides an overview of the transformative organizational, technological and informational challenges ahead.},

To shed light on these collaboration dynamics, the interplay between two integral parts of collaborative projects: the project rules, procedures, and structures (collectively known as institutional design) and the leaders managing these projects is studied. In doing so, the paper provides empirically grounded insights into the management of collaborative government digitalisation projects. Taking an institutional perspective, and the strategic-relational approach (SRA), we examine the extent to which institutional design constraints leadership behaviours, and under what conditions leaders begin to adjust and/or challenge these design features adding to the knowledge of managing digitalisation of government. To this end, we present a five-country case study of national digitalisation projects across Europe. Our results show that while clear institutional design features such as established rules, project structures, and standard operating procedures are essential at the initial stages of the projects, leaders' skills in understanding and tailoring these features are critical to handle project-related problems and moving forwards towards implementation. This underscores the importance of examining projects taking an SRA approach and the need to understand leadership behaviour in the context of the structures in which it is embedded.},

abstract = {Digitizing public services is, at the moment, an essential necessity for numerous governments around the world. An improved government through digitization will not only have a growing effect on businesses, but it will also be able to intensify citizen engagement and push for economic growth. During the last 10 years more countries have progressively begun to provide digital services to their citizens. Therefore, in order to address this development, the purpose of this paper is to analyze the evolution of the digital government literature in order to describe the aspects of digital transformation in the public sector and how it is related to knowledge management. In this study the methodology is quantitative and it is based on a review and a survey made with the main goal being the estimation from several collected data on how the digital transformation process in the Public Administration takes place and what its relationship is with knowledge management. The review study is based on articles found on Scopus database and it addresses the role that digital government research plays in the theory and practice of knowledge management. In the survey study, 54 employees working for the services of the two governmental areas of the Portuguese Ministry of the Environment were surveyed. The results show that the research on the theme is still at an exploratory stage due to the lack of studies relating digital government to knowledge management effectiveness in the public sector. The results also show that the success of digital government seems to be related with the quality of the organizations' knowledge management, complementing each other for significant improvements in the public sector. In terms of originality, this study aims to contribute and stimulate data-driven discussions regarding the impacts of the digital transformation in the public sector and their relation with the implementation of knowledge management practices.

abstract = {The "new public management" (NPM) wave in public sector organizational change was founded on themes of disaggregation, competition, and incentivization. Although its effects are still working through in countries new to NPM, this wave has now largely stalled or been reversed in some key "leading-edge" countries. This ebbing chiefly reflects the cumulation of adverse indirect effects on citizens' capacities for solving social problems because NPM has radically increased institutional and policy complexity. The character of the post-NPM regime is currently being formed. We set out the case that a range of connected and information technology-centered changes will be critical for the current and next wave of change, and we focus on themes of reintegration, needs-based holism, and digitization changes. The overall movement incorporating these new shifts is toward "digital-era governance" (DEG), which involves reintegrating functions into the governmental sphere, adopting holistic and needs-oriented structures, and progressing digitalization of administrative processes. DEG offers a perhaps unique opportunity to create self-sustaining change, in a broad range of closely connected technological, organizational, cultural, and social effects. But there are alternative scenarios as to how far DEG will be recognized as a coherent phenomenon and implemented successfully.},

abstract = {As interest in the digital transformation of public administration grows, the main challenge remains to improve government governance systems and integrate a wider range of evidence into decision-making processes. The successful digitalization and application of such approaches improves the quality, responsiveness and flexibility of public administrations. The digialtization of processes has made it possible to use micro-level data to assess the impact of a policy or program and apply the feedback to improve the design and delivery of public services. Evidence-based policy-making evaluates programs based on their visible impacts. Large-scale data collected through digitized governance, coupled with econometric impact assessment, provides an ideal working toolkit for this. However, the current situation of European governments is one of slow adoption, as they are often slow to respond to new challenges. This is due to the static one-off impact assessment approaches used, the results of which quickly become outdated. With further digitalization, improvement of systems, and a rapidly changing situation, there is a need to speed up institutions' ability to quickly draw working solutions to offset the effects of unexpected events in society and economy and react without delays if policy effects dissipate. This paper demonstrates how a high level of digitalization in government allows addressing such issues by automating causal impact assessment and making it a continuous part of the service delivery. The use case is an automated system for assessing active labour market policies in Estonia using individual-level data from government digital registers. Building on this, it shows how impact assessment automation depends on automatically generated data, only available due to the digitalization of other public services, and how versatile it is when it comes to proving casual evidence in a suddenly changing environment.},

The rapid use of digital technology in the public sector may marginalize groups without access to or familiarity with digital platforms. This can create a digital divide, worsening inequities by leaving people who cannot access digital services behind. This research will examine public service delivery digital transformation projects and their effects on local governments. The study uses a thorough literature evaluation and case studies of digital transformation projects in different nations. Scopus was used to find relevant content and current public sector digitization research, papers, and publications and they were examined. The study included a variety of opinions on the issue. The assessment found that digital transformation improves efficiency, citizen involvement, and government accountability in public service delivery. Digital transformation may face obstacles that must be overcome. This research demonstrated that improving organizational efficiency, meeting citizen expectations, and responding to superior demands from higher authorities drive digital change in public service delivery. This study stresses technological readiness as a critical driver of local government digital transformation. Opponents' concerns should be addressed in future research and practice, such as digital service delivery inclusivity and accessibility, cost and resource management, and data security and privacy.},

abstract = {In an unexpected circumstance, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, public service delivery cannot be suspended, but must be delivered online, relying on the available digital technology. Social media, specifically, have been widely used to reach a broader portion of the population. This article discusses the digital acceleration that governments and organizations are now facing. The focus is on Italian state museums, which have been pushed for years to adopt digital tools to increase participation. This article highlights three main dilemmas in service delivery: user engagement; planning and control; and costs. The three dilemmas show the social and organizational challenges connected to digital transformation, underlining the issues that organizations will have to face in the future and not just in an emergency such as COVID-19. IMPACT How should public sector institutions use digital technologies for service delivery in unexpected circumstances, such as the COVID-19 pandemic? Starting from the empirical setting of 100 Italian state museums, this article shows how digital technologies, and social media particularly, can be a powerful tool for public service delivery when an onsite service cannot be provided. The authors explain the benefits of online service delivery, for example broader audiences and new ways of interacting with users. They also highlight areas that need discussion and further research, for example whether online services should be provided with a fee or free and the trade-off between carefully planning a digital transformation and reacting promptly to catastrophic events.},

abstract = {Increased use of the Internet and related technologies in government seems to hold out promise for a collaborative governance model, derived from cross‐agency information and knowledge sharing, but many governments struggle to attain this goal. Over the past decade, many local and federal government entities in the United Arab Emirates witnessed a shift from the traditional, hierarchical ‘silos mode' of governance into a ‘competitive mode,' heavily influenced by ‘New Public Management' approaches. Although competition has had a relatively positive impact on government efficiency, there is evidence that it has increased institutional and policy complexity, reduced levels of trust and decreased knowledge sharing in government, thereby reinforcing information silos and hindering collaboration and cross‐government innovations. This article reports a national survey of UAE government employees in federal and local government institutions which found that ‘technology,' ‘leadership' and ‘trust' are perceived as the top three interconnected enablers of collaboration in the UAE government. The article concludes that there is now a possibility to move towards a more collaborative mode in governance, using technological innovations to bring down the cost of social transactions in government, with three key prerequisites: fostering a comfortable level of ‘political trust' between society and government, achieving a threshold of social acceptance of technology ('technological trust') within the public sector and reforming the ‘social trust' dynamics in society.},

abstract = {This study addresses the growing challenges faced by governments in utilising the potential of AI and data analytics for digital transformation, focusing on how these technologies can enhance public service delivery, transparency, and citizen engagement. Despite their transformative potential, majority of the governments struggle with the adoption and integration of AI-powered systems due to infrastructural, regulatory, and ethical concerns. The aim of this study is to investigate the role of data analytics and visualization tools in accelerating digital transformation within AI-powered governments. By synthesizing relevant theories such as the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT), Institutional Theory, and the Dynamic Capabilities Framework, this conceptual paper provides a strong theoretical foundation for understanding AI adoption in governance. The methodology involves a comprehensive literature review, analysing past studies and theoretical frameworks related to AI, data analytics, and public sector digital transformation. The findings reveal that AI-powered systems can significantly improve governance outcomes by enabling real-time insights and decision-making, while visualization tools enhance transparency and accountability. However, challenges remain, particularly regarding data privacy, digital infrastructure, and equitable access to services. The study's implications are both theoretical and practical. Theoretically, it contributes to understanding how AI and data analytics are reshaping governance, while practically, it highlights the need for governments to invest in digital infrastructure and develop dynamic capabilities to adapt to technological advancements. Future research should focus on addressing the specific challenges faced by emerging economies and exploring the ethical implications of AI in governance.},
